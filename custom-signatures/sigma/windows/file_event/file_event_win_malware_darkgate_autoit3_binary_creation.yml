id: 1a433e1d-03d2-47a6-8063-ece992cf4e73
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects the usage of curl.exe, KeyScramblerLogon, or other non-standard/suspicious processes used to create Autoit3.exe.
    This activity has been associated with DarkGate malware, which uses Autoit3.exe to execute shellcode that performs
    process injection and connects to the DarkGate command-and-control server. Curl, KeyScramblerLogon, and these other
    processes consitute non-standard and suspicious ways to retrieve the Autoit3 executable.
