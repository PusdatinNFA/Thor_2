    definition: The "Audit Directory Service Changes" logging policy must be configured
        in order to receive events. Audit events are generated only for objects with
        configured system access control lists (SACLs). Audit events are generated
        only for objects with configured system access control lists (SACLs) and only
        when accessed in a manner that matches their SACL settings. This policy covers
        the following events ids - 5136, 5137, 5138, 5139, 5141. Note that the default
        policy does not cover User objects. For that a custom AuditRule need to be
        setup (See https://github.com/OTRF/Set-AuditRule)
