falsepositives: A domain may be transferred to another AWS account by a system or
    network administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname
    should be making changes in your environment. Domain transfers from unfamiliar
    users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives,
    it can be exempted from the rule.
